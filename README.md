## Project Descriptions

### Exception Handling Assignment
  For this assignment, I created a program that takes an integer input from the user and then loops through a list of integers, dividing each by the user input. It utilizes a try/catch block to alert the user if they try to divide by zero, use a string instead of an integer, or have any other possible errors. This also uses a foreach loop, an integer list, math operators, and data casting.

### Array Assignment
  This was a C# assignment in Visual Studio in which I created a string array, an integer array, and a string list. I prompted the user for indices to each array and the lists. I used if/else statements to throw an error message if the user chose an invalid index number. If they chose a valid index, the program prints the value in the array or list at that index. This uses if/else branching statements, arrays, and lists.

### Package Express Assignment
  For this assignment in Visual Studio, I created a C# program that first took input from the user on package weight. If the weight exceeded 50 lbs, the user is given an alert that their package is too heavy, and the program ends. If it does not exceed the weight limit, the program gathers information on the package size. If the package is too large, the user is alerted and the program ends. If it is not too large, the price quote is calculated and printed to the user's screen. This uses if/else branching statements, nested branching, decimal data typing, math operators, boolean comparisons, the Math.Round() function, and String.Format().

### Car Insurance Approval Program
  This was an assignment in Visual Studio to create a program using C# that would take input from the user on their age, whether or not they had a DUI, and the number of speeding tickets they had. It then used boolean logic to determine whether or not the person qualified for the insurance. 

### Anonymous Income Comparison Program
  This was an assignment in Visual Studio using C# to take input from the user for the hourly pay rate and the weekly hours worked for two employees, calculates their yearly salary, and compares their yearly income. It uses math operators, decimal data typing, casting, and boolean comparison.

### Math and Operators Console Assignment
  This was a simple assignment in Visual Studio to create a C# program that took integer input from a user and performed either multiplication, addition, division, comparison, or modulus remainder operations on those integers. It uses math operators, data typing, casting, integers, and boolean comparisons.

### Daily Report Assignment
  This was a simple assignment in Visual Studio to create a program using C# to gather information from a student for a daily report. It uses data typing, casting, Console.WriteLine() and Console.ReadLine.
